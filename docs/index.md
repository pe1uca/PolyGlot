> Welcome to PolyGlot, an [open source](https://github.com/DraqueT/PolyGlot) tool set that helps to build constructed languages! PolyGlot is a project that I have been working on for some time, and it continues to become more stable and capable with each release. If you have ideas, find bugs, or have any comments at all, please feel free to email me at <draquemail@gmail.com> or post them on [PolyGlot's issues page](https://github.com/DraqueT/PolyGlot/issues)!

As the creator of PolyGlot says, this tool set will help you build your own constructed languages.  
Being an open source project I took the initiative to port this great application to Android.  

This version can be downloaded from the [github releases page](https://github.com/pe1uca/PolyGlot/releases) or directly from the [Google play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.darisadesigns.polyglotlina.android)

You can find the [source code in github](https://github.com/pe1uca/PolyGlot/tree/android) where you can [report issues or suggestions](https://github.com/pe1uca/PolyGlot/issues).  
You can also contact me at <pe1ucadev@gmail.com> or on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/pe1uca).
