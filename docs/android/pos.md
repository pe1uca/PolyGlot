# Parts of speech

*From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_of_speech)*

> Category of words that have similar grammatical properties. Words that are assigned to the same part of speech generally display similar syntactic behavior, sometimes similar morphology in that they undergo inflection for similar properties and even similar semantic behavior.  
> Commonly listed English parts of speech are noun, verb, adjective, adverb, pronoun, preposition, conjunction, interjection, numeral, article, or determiner.

Part of speech (PoS) should not be confused with noun classes (a.k.a grammatical gender).  

## Adding a PoS  

In the bottom right corner you'll find the "+" button to add a PoS to your conlang.  
When you click it you'll be taken to the [PoS info screen](#pos-info-screen), where you'll be able to add the information about the PoS.  

## Editing an existing PoS  

Once you have a PoS listed in for your conlang, you'll be able to click on it to open the [PoS info screen](#pos-info-screen) to manage it and access the conjugations/declensions screens.  

## PoS info screen  

<div class="admonition warning">  
	<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>  
	<p>
		Pay attention when you leave this screen.  
		<br>
		If your PoS is invalid, i.e. it doesn't have a name, 
		it'll be deleted when you double click the back button.  
	</p>  
</div>  

In the top right corner you'll see a trash can, click it to delete this PoS (This can not be undone).  

Similar to [lexeme info screen](lexicon.md#lexeme-info-screen), when you click the back button, if the lexeme is valid it'll be saved, otherwise an error will show up.  
If you double click the back button with an invalid PoS it'll be deleted.  

In the bottom of the screen you'll find options for the [inflections (conjugations/declensions)](pos-inflections.md) of this PoS.
