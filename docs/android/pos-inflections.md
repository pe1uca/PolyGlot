# Part of Speech inflections  

*From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection)*

> Process of word formation in which a word is modified to express different grammatical categories such as tense, case, voice, aspect, person, number, gender, mood, animacy, and definiteness.   
> The inflection of verbs is called *conjugation*, and one can refer to the inflection of nouns, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, determiners, participles, prepositions and postpositions, numerals, articles, etc., as *declension*.  

Inflections are managed inside the [part of speech screen](pos.md#pos-info-screen).  

<div class="admonition note">  
	<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>  
	<p>In the current version of PolyGlot android, inflections are labeled as "conjugations" or "conjugations/declensions".</p>  
</div> 

## Add an inflection  

You'll find a button to "Add conjugation/declension" after the properties of a PoS.  
This operation might need to clear up some internal values, instead of deleting them, it marks them as deprecated.  

You'll be asked to provide a name for this inflection.  
After that you'll see the inflection information screen.
