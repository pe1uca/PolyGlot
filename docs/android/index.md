	<p>Be sure to save your file before creating a new file or opening an existing one.</p>  
</div>  

#### New file  

PolyGlot will clean itself up so you can start from scratch a new conlang, like opening the app for the first time.  

### Open file  

If you already have a PolyGlot file containing your conlang, select this option to browser for it.  

### Save file  

When you have made some progress select this option to store your file and be able to open it in the future either with this app or with the desktop one.  
The next time you open PolyGlot the conlang that was last saved will be opened by default.
