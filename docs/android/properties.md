# Language properties  

This is the first screen that you'll see when you open PolyGlot.  

Here you'll find the description of your conlang as well as some options of how the app behaves.

	<p>If you come from desktop you've noticed there are some missing properties.   
	There's still work to do to properly show them in here.</p>

### Settings  

These control how PolyGlot validates your conlang and how it behaves.  
Here's the description of each setting if you set it.  
Most of these come in place in the [lexicon](lexicon.md).  

- **Part of speech mandatory**   
	Words in the lexicon must have a part of speech selected.  

- **Local uniqueness**  
	Words in the lexicon must not have the same text for "Local language word".  

- **Word uniqueness**  
	Words in the lexicon must not be repeated (i.e. no homonyms).  

- **Ignore case**  
	Features of PolyGlot will not differentiate between lower and upper case letters.  

- **Disable Orthographic regex**  
	Disables regex functionaliy in phonology. 
	(Phonology is not yet implemented)   

- **Enforce RTL**  
	Makes PolyGlot display your conlang Right To Left.

- **Local mandatory**  
	Words in the lexicon must have a "Local language word".  

- **Override regex font**  
	Fields that accept a regex will use the local language font instead of the conlang font.  
	(Only noticable if you import a language with a conlang font from desktop)  

- **Local word lexicon display**  
	Meant to display the [lexicon](lexicon.md) using the local word instead of the conlang word.  
	(It has no effect in Android version. This is used in desktop versions).
